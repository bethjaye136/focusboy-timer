## 👾 About The Project

**FocusBoy** is a nostalgic take on the Pomodoro technique, blending the "Y2K Handheld" aesthetic with professional-grade timekeeping logic.

I built this because most web timers are either boring, glitchy, or just don't fit the vibe. FocusBoy is designed to be **embedded**, **customizable**, and **drift-free**. It's not just a timer; it's a desk companion with fun interactive features.

## ✨ Features

- **⏱️ Custom Timer:** Set any duration (minutes) for your focus session.
- **🎨 4 Color Themes:** Switch between Grey, Teal, Purple, and Yellow consoles.
- **💾 Memory Function:** Remembering your custom time setting for easy resets.
- **📱 Responsive:** Floating layout perfect for embedding in dashboards.
- **⏱️ Drift-Free Precision:** Unlike standard JS timers that lose sync, FocusBoy uses `Date.now()` delta-checks to ensure 100% accuracy, even if the tab is inactive.
- **🎨 Dynamic Theming:** 4 switchable "Skins" (Atomic Purple, Teal, classic Grey, Yellow) powered by CSS Variables.
- **💾 Smart State:** Handles browser interruptions gracefully without losing your progress.
- **📱 Widget Ready:** Floating, responsive layout designed perfectly for Notion dashboards or OBS overlays.

## 🧠 Extra Details

This wasn't just about CSS; the logic needed to be solid.

### Fixing the drifting/glitch issue

Standard `setInterval` loops often drift by a few milliseconds when the browser main thread is busy. To fix this, I implemented a **Delta-Time** approach:

1.  Calculates the exact `Target Time` (Timestamp) immediately upon start.
2.  The loop constantly checks the difference between `Now` and `Target`.
3.  This ensures the timer is accurate to the millisecond, regardless of CPU load.

### CSS Architecture

Instead of loading multiple stylesheets, I used **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** scoped to the `<body>`.

    /* Example of the Skin System */
    body.skin-1 { --screen-color: #73c700; }
    body.skin-2 { --screen-color: #007198; }

This allows the entire color scheme (borders, text, SVGs) to update instantly with a single class change in JavaScript.

## 🚀 Embed in Notion

FocusBoy is built to live in your workspace.

1.  Copy the live link: `[INSERT YOUR LINK HERE]`
2.  Go to your Notion page.
3.  Type `/embed` and paste the link.
4.  Resize the block until the Gameboy fits perfectly!
